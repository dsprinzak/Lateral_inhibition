Lateral inhibition code
=======================

This code is part of the lateral inhibition tutorial (Formosa-Jordan and Sprinzak, 2014). This is a Matlab code. The full code is not here yet, but it will be uploaded soon. The Matlab files you can find are:

- twocell_LI.m : it simulates lateral inhibition dynamics between two cells.
- multicell_LI.m : it simulates lateral inhibition in a hexagonal lattice. 
- paramsearch_LI.m : it simulates and plots the log(Dmax/Dmin) and the time required for patterning for different betaD and betaR.
- transcis2cell_LI.m: it simulates trans-annihilation with cis-inactivation between two cells.
- transcis_multicell_LI.m: it simulates trans-annihilation with cis-inactivation in a hexagonal lattice.
- morphogen_LI.m:  it simulates lateral inhibition in a hexagonal lattice.
- largespacing_LI.m: it simulates lateral inhibition in a hexagonal lattice with  next nearest neighbors interactions between cells.
